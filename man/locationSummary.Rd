\arguments{
\item{s}{a single chain or a list of parallel chains generated by
\code{estelleMetropolis} or \code{stellaMetropolis}.}

\item{time}{the times corresponding to the x locations.}

\item{discard}{number of initial samples to discard.}

\item{alpha}{coverage of the credible intervals calculated by
\code{locationSummary}.}

\item{collapse}{whether to collapse parallel chains to a single chain}

\item{chains}{the set of chains to retain, or \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
\item{\code{locationSummary}}{returns a dataframe or a list of
dataframes of summary quantities for each location.}
\item{\code{locationMean}}{returns an array or a list of arrays
of the means of the samples for each location.}

\description{
Summarize a set of location samples
}
\details{
These functions compute various summaries of a sample or list of
samples generated by \code{estelleMetropolis} or
\code{stellaMetropolis}.

These functions accept either a sample from a single mcmc run, or
a list of samples from parallel mcmc runs.  When \code{collapse}
is true, multiple samples are merged and single result is
returned, otherwise a result is returned for each sample.
