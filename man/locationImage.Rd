\arguments{
\item{s}{a single chain or a list of parallel chains generated by
\code{estelleMetropolis} or \code{stellaMetropolis}.}

\item{xlim}{range of the first coordinate.}

\item{ylim}{range of the second coordinate.}

\item{nx}{number of cells in the first coordinate.}

\item{ny}{number of cells in the second coordinate.}

\item{weight}{weights for each location.}

\item{discard}{number of initial samples to discard.}

\item{collapse}{whether to collapse parallel chains to a single chain}

\item{chains}{the set of chains to retain, or \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
A list with elesments
\item{\code{x}}{the x-ordinates that bound the bins}
\item{\code{y}}{the y-ordinates that bound the bins}
\item{\code{W}}{the weighted image.}
}
\description{
Bin locations to form a 2D density image
}
\details{
Bins the samples for a sequence of locations to produce 2D array
suitable for plotting with \code{image}.  Optionally, a vector of
weights can be provided to differentially weight samples by
location.

This function accepts either a sample from a single mcmc run, or
a list of samples from parallel mcmc runs.  If
\code{collapse} is true, multiple samples are merged and single
image is returned, otherwise an image is returned for each sample.
