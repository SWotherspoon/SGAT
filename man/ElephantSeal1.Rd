\format{
\code{ElephantSeal1} A data frame with 3 columns.  The
columns represent
\tabular{rl}{

\code{ElephantSeal2} This tag is similar to \code{ElephantSeal1}
but also has columns
\tabular{rl}{
\code{depth} \tab depth in the water column in metres (positive) \cr
\code{temp} \tab temperature in the water column in degrees celcius \cr

\description{
Light data from the foraging trips of the Southern elephant seal.
}
\details{
Light intensity measurements over time from an archival tag on a
Southern elephant seal (\emph{Mirounga leonina}).  The seal was
tagged at the isthmus on Macquarie Island (158.950E, 54.5S), with
data from a time-depth-recorder (Mk9 TDR; Wildlife Computers,
Seattle, WA, USA).  These tags provides regular time series of
measurements of depth, water temperature, and ambient light
level. The original data for \code{ElephantSeal1} were processed
to remove values at depths greater than 15m and to classify
periods of twilight. The data for \code{ElephantSeal2} have also
been processed for twilight periods. The seals makes one single
foraging trip, returning to the isthmus where they were tagged.
Data recorded while the seal is at the isthmus are used for
calibration (\code{\link{ElephantSeal1calib}}).
