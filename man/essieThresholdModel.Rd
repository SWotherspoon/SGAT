\description{
Threshold Model Structures for Essie
}
\details{
Essie requires a model structure that describes the model being
fitted. This function generates basic model structures for
threshold twilight data that should provide a suitable starting
point for most analyses.

The \code{essieThresholdModel} function constructs a model structure
assuming that each twilight time is associated with a single
location.

One of several models models may be selected for the errors in
twilight times.  The errors in twilight time are defined as the
difference in the observed and true times of twilight, with sign
selected so that a positive error always corresponds to a sunrise
observed after the true time of sunrise, and sunset observed
before the true time of sunset. That is, a positive error
corresponds to the observed light level being lower than expected.

The properties of the twilight model are determined by
\code{alpha}, which must be a vector of parameters that are
to be applied to each twilight.

The \code{twilight.model} argument selects the distribution of the
twilight errors
\describe{
\item{'Normal'}{Normally distributed with mean \code{alpha[,1]} and
standard deviation \code{alpha[,2]},}
\item{'LogNormal'}{Log Normally distributed so the log errors have
mean \code{alpha[,1]} and standard deviation \code{alpha[,2]}, or}
\item{'Gamma'}{Gamma distributed with shape \code{alpha[,1]} and
rate \code{alpha[,2]}.}
}

The initialization locations \code{x0} are only required when
specifying fixed locations.

Essie assumes that the average speed of travel between successive
locations is Gamma distributed. By default, the speed of travel is
calculated based on the time intervals between the twilights (in
hours), but the intervals of time actually available for travel
can be specified directly with the \code{dt} argument. The
parameters \code{beta[1]} and \code{beta[2]} specify the shape and
rate of the Gamma distribution of speeds.

Twilights can be missing because either the light record was too
noisy at that time to estimate twilight reliably, or because the
tag was at very high latitude and no twilight was observed.
Missing twilights should be replaced with an approximate time of
twilight, and the vector \code{missing} used to indicate which
twilights are approximate and which are true.  This should be a
vector of integers, one for each twilight where the integer codes
signify
\describe{
\item{0:}{The twilight is not missing.}
\item{1:}{The twilight is missing, but a twilight did occur.}
\item{2:}{The twilight is missing because twilight did not occur.}
\item{3:}{The twilight is missing and it is not known if a twilight occurred.}
