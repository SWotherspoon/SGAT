\description{
Fit an Essie model
}
\details{
Essie is a discrete analog of Stella that only considers locations
on a lattice of grid points.

The posterior probability that the tag is at a particular location
is determined by a two pass recursive algorithm.  The forward
sweep propogates location information forward in time, the
backward sweep propogates location information backward in time,
and the full posterior is a compromise of these two.

The method is only approximate and is controlled by the two
tolerances \code{epsilon1} and \code{epsilon2}.  The first limits
the precision of the likelihood - locations for which the
likelihood fall below \code{epsilon1} of its maximum are ignored.
The second limits the precision of the transition probabilities -
locations for which the probability below \code{epsilon2} of the
maximum are ignored in the movement calculation.  The smaller
these parameters are set, the slower but more accurate the fit.
