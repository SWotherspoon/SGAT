SGAT2Movebank(
  s,
  time = NULL,
  group = NULL,
  discard = 0,
  alpha = 0.95,
  chains = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{a single chain or a list of parallel chains generated by
\code{estelleMetropolis} or \code{stellaMetropolis}.}

\item{time}{the times corresponding to the x locations.}

\item{group}{integer vector that defines the twilight groups.  If
code{group[k]==j} then the k-th twilight occurs at location j. Default is \code{NULL} for non-grouped models.}

\item{discard}{number of initial samples to discard.}

\item{alpha}{coverage of the credible intervals calculated by
\code{locationSummary}.}

\item{chains}{the set of chains to retain, or \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
\item{\code{SGAT2Movebank}}{returns a dataframe of summary quantities for each location or grouped location.}
